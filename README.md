# -Abaqus-HASHIN-progressive-Damage-for-3D-continuum-composites-VUMAT-Subroutine-
Hashin criteria predict failure modes in composites based on stresses in fiber and matrix. While effective, implementing them in numerical simulations poses challenges. Abaqus addresses this but is limited to 2D plane stress. A VUMAT subroutine extends Abaqus to simulate 3D damage progression using the energy method for static and dynamic problems.

In this Project, our focus is on the implementation of progressive damage, in contrast to our other package, which considers instantaneous damage, based on the Hashin criterion in Abaqus. However, to familiarize you with the foundation of this criterion and others, we first discuss the formulation theories for various composite failure criteria. This will provide you with a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts. Next, we move on to the Abaqus model, covering topics such as modeling 3D composites in Abaqus, defining damage criteria for composites within the software, and related concepts.

Additionally, two workshops are included to guide you in practically defining these models and even writing VUMAT subroutines. Some parts of the subroutine is uploaded here, while you can access the full project files in CAE ASSISTANT website.
